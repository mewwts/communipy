#communitydetection

Implementation of some community detection algorithms for my project and master's thesis.

2014-01-15: Implementation of the Louvain method is complete.
2014-06-23: Diffusion and Propagation Algorithm finished. Novel approaches Degree-rank and Community-dissolve too.

##Todo:
- [ ] Is there something to gain by representing A as a DOK-matrix?


## Ideas:
- [x] CSR-matrix with Python lists? Doable, but what we really want is O(1) access to indiv. elements. DOK-format does this, perhaps it should be considered.
