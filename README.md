#communitydetection
==================
Implementation of some community detection algorithms for my project and master's thesis.

2014-01-15: Implementation of the Louvain method is complete.

##Todo:
- [ ] General:
    - [ ] Generate weighted networks
    - [ ] Symmetrize by reciprocal ties

- [ ] Labelpropagation
    - [ ] Best match = -1
    - [ ] Infinite recursion
- [ ] Degree-Rank
    - [ ] What subset of the vertices should be fed to the inner loop?
- [ ] Community-Dissolve


## Ideas:
- [ ] CSR-matrix with Python lists?
