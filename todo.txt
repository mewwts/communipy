Improvements:
- implement louvain.make_C_matrix with a COO to make it much faster
- store np.sum(k[c]) for all communities c.
- parallelize some calculation
- initialize C with generatorexpressions


Issues:
- Absolute vs. relative gain in modularity in louvain.py
- map with lambda apparantly slower than list comprehension
- gains are too high // modularity is not calculated right
-
